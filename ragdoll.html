    <div class="history">
        <h2 id="his">HISTORY</h2>
        <p>The ragdoll cat breed is relatively new. It was developed in California 
            in the 1960s. A cat breeder named Ann Baker wanted to create a beautiful
             cat with a loving personality. She started by breeding a domestic 
             long-haired, white cat of unknown origin named Josephine with several 
             Burmese-like cats.
            <br>
            Though it took a few generations, Baker eventually produced the first
             cats she called ragdolls. These cats were appreciated for their
              non-matting fur, large size, and outgoing personalities.
            <br>
            The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) began registering ragdolls in 1993.
             Ragdolls are consistently one of the most popular cat breeds registered
              by the CFA.</p>

        <h2 id="char">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <p>The big, beautiful ragdoll cat does not reach its full size, about 15 pounds
             on average, until about four years of age. With its easygoing personality 
             and social temperament, the ragdoll is ready to be friends with just about 
             anyone. Ragdoll cats are very kind to people, have zero aggression toward 
             people, and are very loyal to their owners, so many people are willing to 
             buy a puppet cat and raise it at home to accompany the elderly and children, 
             especially children. It will quietly lie beside the sleeping children and watch
              over them.  </p>
               <p>It is characterized by a large and wedge-shaped head, flat top of the head, 
                dark blue eyes, a round snout, a slight depression on the short nose, some "V"-shaped 
                markings on the face, and a long coat on the neck. It belongs to the category of hairy cats.
                Ragdoll cat's hair is very long, and it feels very smooth and soft, especially when it walks 
                gracefully. Its hair is not only a single color, but also matched with other colors, which is perfect. Its hair is fluffy and looks very textured.</p>

    <div class="app">
        <h2 id="app">APPEARANCES</h2>
        <p>Purebred ragdoll kittens are born solid white due to a genetic mutation. Their coats begin 
            to develop colors and patterns around two months of age but don't fully develop their coloration
             for about two years. </p>
             <p>A ragdoll's medium-length coat is silky-soft and often compared to rabbit fur. It is considered 
                a "pointed breed," meaning its body is lighter colored than its points (face, ears, legs, and tail).
                 Its fur is somewhat longer and thicker around its neck, giving the appearance of a mane. Their ears
                  are relatively small and slightly rounded.</p>
                  <p>These large cats are not overly muscled; they are rather soft and quite flexible.</p>
