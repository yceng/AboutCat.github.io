          Minuet cat is a kind of Napoleon short-legged cat, which is divided
          into long-haired Napoleon cat and short-haired Napoleon cat. This cat
          is characterized by its short legs, which are much shorter than those
          of normal cats, but it will not affect its walking and running speed.
          Minuet cat is a combination of a Munchkin cat and a Persian cat, which
          inherits the sweetness of a Persian cat and the short legs of a
          Munchkin cat.

    <div class="history">
      <h2 id="his">HISTORY</h2>
      <p>The Minuet Cat is a relatively new breed created in 1996. But, while the founder,
         Joe Smith, was hoping to develop a short-legged breed by crossing Persians with 
         Munchkin Cats, he quickly realized that genetics wasn't on his side. Because the 
         short-legged gene is recessive in cats, the chances of all Minuet kittens in a litter
          having short legs are extremely low.</p>
          
      <p>Smith was able to obtain a Munchkin cat in 1996, and it was discovered that this kitten 
        had Persian ancestry. He was then able to obtain an Exotic cat. When the Exotic and Munchkin 
        had a litter of kittens in 1997, they possessed the traits that Joe desired.</p>
        
      <p>This breed was originally known as the Napoleon, but The International Cat Association (TICA)
         changed its name to Minuet in 2015.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="charac">
      <h2 id="char">CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
      <p>The Minuet cat is distinguished by its short stature, which is why it was named after Napoleon 
        Bonaparte. Despite the fact that many of these cats have short legs, some kittens are born with 
        long legs. The following are the breed's most important physical characteristics.</p>
        
      <p>The Minuet is a short-legged medium-sized cat breed. These cats were purposefully bred with short 
        legs. They typically weigh 5 to 9 pounds and stand 7 to 8 inches tall.</p>
        
      <p>The Minuet is not only a cute breed in appearance, but it also has a charming personality. Because 
        they enjoy being around people, these cats are very affectionate and social. Minuet cats, like Persians,
         are incredibly gentle, but they also have the curiosity and energy that Munchkins are known</p>
    </div>
    <div class="app">
      <h2 id="app">APPEARANCES</h2>
      <p>Unlike other cat breeds with a distinct appearance that makes them easy to identify, Minuet cats come in
         every color and pattern, including those not traditional Persian colors. Donâ€™t be surprised if you come 
         across shaded, mink, pointed, sepia, chocolate, lilac, bi-color, or cinnamon Minuet kitties, for example. 
         They can also have white skin and green eyes.</p>
      <p>Minuet also includes short hair and long hair. Moreover, cats in Minuet have a lot of furs, and their fur
         grows away from their bodies. The only difference between long hair and short hair is the appearance of the 
         coat. Short hair is comfortable to the touch and suitable for all seasons. Long hair is a long coat like 
         silk with legs and a feathery tail.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pros">
      <h2 id="pro">PROS</h2>
      <p>The Minuet is a sweet, loving, easy-going cat. They are outgoing and social, so be ready to give the Minuet 
        plenty of love and attention. In fact, the moment you return home, the Minuet will be at your feet, ready to 
        follow you. Because of their affinity for attention, the Minuet is a trainable cat. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cons">
      <h2 id="con">CONS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Genetic defect</strong>  :    The reason why a minuet cat is short-legged is that its congenital
             elbow joints are stunted, its limbs are shortened, and it is more prone to problems such as rickets and 
             uncoordinated elbow joints. Therefore, keeping this kind of cat must pay attention to controlling its weight.</li>
          <li><strong>Easy to get dirty</strong>  :    Because the minuet cat has a low chassis, the fur on its belly is 
            more likely to touch the floor, especially the long hair. Like the automatic mop at home, its belly is always 
            dirty. And the limited legs will make the cat's hygiene a little difficult.</li>
        </ul>
